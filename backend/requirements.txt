# Notes:
# - If you prefer a much smaller runtime, consider replacing `tensorflow` with `tflite-runtime`
#   and patching `contexts/pred_with_audio.py` to prefer `tflite_runtime.interpreter`.
#   Example (in requirements):
#     tflite-runtime
#   If you use tflite-runtime, ensure you pick the correct wheel for the target platform or use Docker base image matching Render's architecture.
